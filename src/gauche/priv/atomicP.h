 * I believe that using gUSA, we could improve libatomic_ops

 * are incompatible to SH-4A, SMP machines.
 *
 * I believe that SH-4A, architecture wise, breaks SH-4 ABI already.
 *
 * If SH-4A machine insists as if it were SH4 (ABI), we can't use
 * gUSA, nor ll/sc equivalents (movli.l/movco.l, IIRC), either.
 * That's totally a mess.
 *
 * Only workaround for both of SH-4 and SH-4A is to downgrade to
 * pthread implementation, so that it will work reliably.
